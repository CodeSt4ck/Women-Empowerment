        <h2>You know when you’re on your period.</h2>
        <h3>
          The blood is flowing, your mood is swinging, and your cramping uterus
          just confirms what you already know to be true.
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>When you’re spotting, things might not be so clear.</h4>
        <p>
          Seeing a few red dots in your underwear could mean so many different
          things: pregnancy, ovulation, stress, a looming visit from Aunt Flo.
          Regardless of how well you know your body and your menstrual cycle,
          unexpected bleeding of any kind can be anxiety inducing. Don’t
          panic—we’ve got the lowdown on spotting before, after, and
          <b><u>in-between</u></b>
          your periods.
        </p>
        <h4>The difference between spotting and your period.</h4>
        <p>
          Generally, periods come every 21 to 35 days. Some women have shorter
          periods that last up to 2 days, while others menstruate for up to 7
          days. Still others can bleed for even longer but this is a sign of a
          heavy period (or menorrhagia) and, although common, is not normal and
          can indicate that there are underlying reproductive issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first day of your period is considered “day 1” of your monthly
          cycle and is often accompanied by period pains:
          <b><u>headaches, cramps, cravings</u></b
          >, and the like. Though it may seem like you’re bleeding out, the
          amount of blood women release is usually between
          <b><u>4 and 7 tablespoons</u></b
          >. The <b><u>color of period blood</u></b> can range but is typically
          red or, if your uterus is shedding off old tissue, brown.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, spotting can occur at any time during your monthly
          cycle and is most likely going to be just a few drops of blood
          throughout the day. Spotting blood is usually either light pink or
          dark brown. Though cramps and periods seem to be best buds, you
          probably won’t feel any pain if you’re spotting—unless you are
          experiencing implantation spotting but we’ll get to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you’re clear on the differences between spotting and having
          your period, let’s move on to the really important stuff: why you’re
          spotting at different times throughout your menstrual cycle.
        </p>
        <h4>You’re stressed.</h4>
        <p>
          When our society glorifies busy-ness and often views a packed schedule
          as a status symbol, who isn’t stressed these days? No one, that’s who.
          Whether it’s stress from a chaotic career, family issues, or just
          general pressure to be amazing at everything (you really are enough,
          lady), increased levels of cortisol can take a toll on your menstrual
          cycle. While missed or <b><u>irregular periods</u></b> are common
          symptoms of being so stressed that you can’t even, so is spotting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can correlate your spotting to times when your stress levels
          are through the roof, you may have identified the cause. Your best bet
          is to do what you can to tone down on the stress — take a bubble bath,
          do some yoga, or just start saying no to things you don’t want to do
          (or don’t really have time for). Managing your stress in a healthy way
          should help your spotting subside and your menstrual cycle go back to
          normal.
        </p>
        <h4>You are ovulating.</h4>
        <p>
          When you finish up your period, your brain signals to your ovaries
          that it’s time to make an egg. When your ovaries release that egg into
          your fallopian tube, you’re <b><u>officially ovulating</u></b
          >. This usually happens around day 14 of your cycle but, of course,
          this can vary if you have a shorter or longer cycle. That 12 to
          24-hour window that your egg is waiting for sperm to find and
          fertilize it can cause bleeding. Though only about 1 to 2 percent of
          women have ovulation spotting, those who do may find that their pink
          or light brown spotting is mixed in with some “egg white” looking
          discharge, which is a sign of ovulation and <b><u>fertility</u></b
          >.
        </p>
        <h4>Your eggo is preggo.</h4>
        <p>
          So, you know how your ovaries release an egg during ovulation? Well,
          if that egg isn’t fertilized, it dissolves into the inner lining of
          your uterus, which is sloughed off during your period. But if it is
          fertilized, it travels back up into your uterus, sperm in tow, and
          implants to start growing a baby. While your egg gets cozy in your
          uterus, you may experience what is known as
          <b><u>implantation bleeding</u></b
          >. This is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy but is not one that
          all women experience. If you do get implantation spotting, it can last
          anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple days and you just might
          feel a little bit of cramping in your lower abdomen.
        </p>
        <h4>Your period just stopped.</h4>
        <p>
          You just put the unused tampons from your purse back into
          <b><u>the little black box</u></b> on your counter (yay!) but – bam! –
          spots of blood in your <b><u>favorite panties</u></b
          >. WTH, right? Well, lady, hate to break it to you but this is one of
          the most common spotting times. The reason behind after-period
          spotting is usually that your uterus didn’t finish flushing out its
          unused inner lining. Unless your period starts again soon after it
          ends, you don’t have anything to worry about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though <b><u>men can’t seem to handle the side effects</u></b> as well
          as women can, <b><u>birth control</u></b> is still such a great
          invention. Especially for those of us who don’t want children (yet or
          ever), dealing with the side effects is well worth it if it means
          preventing pregnancy. One of those side effects is spotting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you just got an IUD,
          <b><u>spotting is a normal symptom</u></b> that can last several
          months. Thankfully, many IUD users eventually have lighter periods or
          no periods at all. Similarly, starting, stopping, or missing a dose of
          an oral contraceptive can cause pink or brown spotting. This is due to
          your estrogen, which keeps the lining of your uterus in place. Doing
          anything that alters your estrogen levels can cause spotting.
        </p>
        <h4>You took a morning after pill.</h4>
        <p>
          That night of fun ended with you popping a Plan B on your way home the
          next morning. You thought all was good in your uterus but now you’re
          spotting. Don’t mistake this as a sign of pregnancy or your period.
          The hormones present in emergency contraceptive—<b
            ><u>estrogen and progesterone—can cause light spotting</u></b
          >. It should go away pretty quickly so put on a pantyliner and go
          celebrate not being pregnant with a mimosa (or 3).
        </p>
        <h4>You have uterine fibroids.</h4>
        <p>
          Uterine fibroids are a type of benign tumor that grow in and around
          the wall of the uterus. Though doctors haven’t identified a specific
          cause of fibroids, they do say that
          <b><u>African American women</u></b> and
          <b><u>overweight women</u></b> are more at risk for developing them.
          Spotting is one of the main side effects, along with infertility,
          <b><u>painful sex</u></b
          >, lower back pain, and a chronically bloated feeling. In other words,
          don’t assume you have uterine fibroids just because you’re spotting.
          There are a lot of other causes that are far more likely.
        </p>
        <h4>You’re sick.</h4>
        <p>
          So this is a little tricky. Being sick with the cold or flu isn’t
          likely to cause spotting but not feeling well when you’re spotting
          could be a sign of another health problem—anything from an STI, like
          chlamydia, to a <b><u>miscarriage</u></b> to cervical cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t jump right to this conclusion, though. It’s another factor you
          can consider but isn’t necessarily a primary cause of spotting. Rule
          out stress, birth control, and pregnancy before you start Googling
          symptoms and diagnosing yourself. Actually, don’t even attempt to
          diagnose yourself. Go to your doctor if you think something is
          wrong—you know your body better than anyone.
        </p>
        <h4>You recently got your first period.</h4>
        <p>
          Reaching your menarche may be the start of a decades-long menstrual
          cycle but rarely are the first few years of bleeding consistent. In
          addition to irregular periods making it hard to know when you’re safe
          to rock your white shorts, spotting is a common occurrence for girls
          who are just getting acquainted with <b><u>tampons</u></b
          >, cramps, and an undeniable craving for chocolate.
        </p>
        <h4>Should you worry?</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t worry until it’s time to worry. Basically, if you can link your
          spotting to stress, birth control, the morning-after pill, or your
          first period, you’re in the clear. If you think you have an STI,
          cervical cancer, are pregnant, or have uterine fibroids, it could be
          time to schedule an appointment with your doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, spotting is normal and nothing to freak out about. It’s not
          something you can (or need to) try and stop. Just let your
          <b><u>uterus</u></b> do its thing. On that note, if you are spotting
          for more than a week at a time, have any pain or discomfort during
          spotting, or just have a feeling that something isn’t right – trust
          your gut instinct and head to your gynecologist.
        </p>
        <p>
          One final point on spotting: don’t use a tampon (even a low-absorbency
          one) to control spotting. This can greatly increase your risks of
          getting Toxic Shock Syndrome. Though using
          <b><u>organic tampons</u></b> eliminate the fear of having toxins in
          your vagina, spotting doesn’t produce nearly enough moisture to make
          using a tampon safe. Stick with a pantyliner and you’ll be just fine.
