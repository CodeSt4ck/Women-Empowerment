        <h2>
          Growing up, many of us were initiated into the period club with two
          options: tampons or pads.
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Pads, often bulky, felt like wearing a diaper while tampons seemed
          terrifying.
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>
          Luckily, girls today have a few more options—options that even those
          of us who have been menstruating for decades are eager to try.
        </h4>
        <p>
          While our comfort can benefit from these new options, the real
          benefactor of period products rising in popularity is Mother Nature.
          Sustainable options such as <b><u>menstrual cups</u></b> and
          <b><u>period underwear</u></b>
          eradicate the idea that period products are, by nature, wasteful, by
          providing us reusable menstruation management.
        </p>
        <p>
          While many menstruators swear by the cup, it can take a few tries to
          figure it out. <b><u>Period underwear</u></b
          >, however, is as simple as it sounds and an excellent alternative to
          period care.
        </p>
        <h4>What is period underwear?</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear looks and feels just like normal underwear. The only
          difference with period underwear is a special layer that helps prevent
          blood from seeping through. You won’t have to deal with the bulky
          discomfort that comes with using pads, though period underwear absorb
          blood similarly. Period underwear is meant to soak up menstrual blood
          while still keeping you as dry and comfortable as possible.

        <h4>What is period underwear?</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear looks and feels just like normal underwear. The only
          difference with period underwear is a special layer that helps prevent
          blood from seeping through. You won’t have to deal with the bulky
          discomfort that comes with using pads, though period underwear absorb
          blood similarly. Period underwear is meant to soak up menstrual blood
          while still keeping you as dry and comfortable as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>Why should I try period underwear?</h4>
        <p>
          While period underwear can be a stand-alone option—Cora’s underwear,
          for example, absorbs up to three tampons’ worth of blood—many
          menstruators also use period underwear as a backup with a tampon or
          cup for heavier flow days. Whether you have a light flow and are
          looking for a sustainable replacement to tampons or pads or you’re
          worried about bleeding through your sheets at night on heavier flow
          days, period underwear may be the answer you’ve been looking for. On
          top of that, period underwear is washable and reusable—imagine having
          an entire cycle without throwing anything in the trash! Here are just
          some of the reasons why period underwear is quickly rising as a
          favorite period product.
        </p>
        <h4>Good backup for heavy flows.</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear is super-absorbent, and typically has multiple layers
          to help protect against leaks. If your flow requires multiple super or
          super plus tampons per day, you won’t want to wear period underwear
          alone for an extended period of time; however, it may be the peace of
          mind backup you need if you ever worry about leaks or getting through
          that one hour meeting when you really need to change your tampon.
        </p>
        <h4>A more sustainable option.</h4>
        <p>
          All the pads, tampons, and liners we go through in a lifetime will end
          up in a landfill—for the average menstruator, that’s about 9,000
          period products over the course of your lifetime. If cutting back on
          waste and helping the environment is important to you (as it should
          be!), then you might want to consider switching to period underwear.
        </p>
        <h4>Convenient for irregular cycles.</h4>
        <p>
          For those of us with <b><u>irregular cycles</u></b
          >, period underwear can be used on the days leading up to your period,
          just in case it arrives unexpectedly when you’re busy and want to
          avoid constantly running to the bathroom to check. Similarly, it’s a
          great option for the last days of your period, if you’ve ever had an
          accident after thinking (wishing?) your period was over.
        </p>
        <h4>Won’t irritate your vagina.</h4>
        <p>
          If you experience vaginal discomfort, pain, and/or
          <b><u>dryness</u></b> or have a condition that makes your vagina
          sensitive or allergic to other forms of period care, period underwear
          might be just what you need. Because period underwear is all-natural,
          free of any chemicals, is designed to be breathable, and does not
          require anything being inserted into the vagina, it shouldn’t cause
          vaginal irritation or dryness for most people.
        </p>
        <h4>Saves you money.</h4>
        <p>
          While the price tag on a pair of period underwear is higher than a box
          of tampons, the majority of period underwear is designed to last for
          around 2-3 years if cared for properly…you do the math! In order to
          make your period underwear last as long as possible, rinse them in the
          sink after use, launder them in cold water on a delicate cycle, and
          hang them to try so they’re ready to go for next month.
        </p>
        <h4>Keeps you comfortable and confident.</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear is great for achieving maximum comfort while still
          keeping you dry and clean. You can wear period underwear while
          exercising, traveling, and being active–which would be more of a
          nuisance when using other forms of period protection like tampons or
          pads. The goal of period underwear is to provide discreet protection,
          while keeping you secure throughout the day no matter what activities
          you’re engaged in.
        </p>
        <h4>Peace of mind even while you sleep.</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear is great to use while you sleep because you won’t
          have to worry about your pad moving and causing leaks to your
          underwear or bed sheets. If you’re a tampon wearer, since you should
          change your tampon regularly due to the risk of
          <b><u>toxic shock syndrome</u></b
          >, period underwear will allow you to comfortably sleep through the
          night without having to worry about getting up to change your tampon.
        </p>
        <h4>Curbs and controls odors.</h4>
        <p>
          Period underwear is designed for every type of flow. It uses a
          leak-resistant layer so the underwear is able to absorb liquids,
          control odors, and dry quickly, keeping the wearer comfortable all
          period long.
